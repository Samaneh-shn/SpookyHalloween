## üìñ **Introduction**

### Context
- In 2016, **Google Cardboard V2** emerged as an affordable VR solution, allowing users to experience VR through their smartphones.
- My thesis explored the potential of **mobile VR** by creating a game that leveraged immersive VR capabilities and integrated motion sensors for enhanced interactivity.

### Objectives
- **Game Design:** Develop a mobile VR game called **Spooky Halloween** for iOS and Android platforms.
- **Enhanced Gameplay:** Integrate motion sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope) for dynamic interactions, going beyond basic head movements.

## üéÆ **Game Concept**

### Theme
- **Spooky Halloween** is a VR adventure set in a spooky environment. Players navigate through eerie challenges to complete objectives.

### Gameplay Mechanics
- **Head Tracking:** Players interact with the game by looking around the environment using the Google Cardboard headset.
- **Interactive Button:** The button on the headset allows players to interact with objects.
- **Motion-Based Interactions:** Tilting and shaking the phone trigger additional actions, such as moving objects or starting events.

## üîß **Tools and Technologies**

1. **Unity and C#:** 
   - Used as the primary game engine to build the VR environment and script game mechanics.
2. **Google Cardboard SDK:**
   - Provided VR support, enabling stereoscopic rendering and head tracking.
3. **Mobile Platforms:**
   - Created platform-specific builds for **iOS** and **Android**.
4. **Java for Sensor Integration:**
   - Developed custom scripts to access motion sensor data (accelerometer and gyroscope) and transmit it via WiFi Direct.

## üöÄ **Technical Highlights**

### Challenges and Solutions
1. **Button Interaction:**
   - Custom logic was implemented to detect button presses, as early SDK versions lacked built-in support.
2. **Sensor Data Integration:**
   - Java scripts accessed real-time accelerometer and gyroscope data and synchronized it with Unity via WiFi Direct.
3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
   - Extensive testing ensured smooth gameplay on both iOS and Android.

### Innovations
- **Interactive Button Logic:**
  - Created custom scripts to handle button interactions, influencing later SDK updates.
- **Motion Sensor Integration:**
  - Enhanced interactivity by enabling phone movements (e.g., tilting, shaking) to influence gameplay.

## üéâ **Results**

- Developed a fully functional VR game compatible with Google Cardboard V2.
- Integrated immersive gameplay mechanics and motion sensor interactivity.
- Achieved cross-platform functionality, demonstrating the potential of mobile VR for gaming.
- Highlighted innovative techniques that advanced mobile VR experiences with limited tools in 2016.
